From Concepts to Confidence: Bridging Knowledge Gaps Through Hands-On Training and Transformation
This portfolio reflects my hands-on leadership in designing, researching, and delivering presentations that empower teams with practical Azure knowledge — combining technical depth with accessible teaching tailored to junior engineers and cross-functional teams.

 

 

🛡️ Identity & Access Management (IAM) — Research, Design, and Deployment Work
🧠 Reflections on My IAM Work
🔍 I researched and documented identity flows and RBAC mechanisms, using hands-on labs to test and validate design decisions.

🤝 We collaborated across security, endpoint, and platform teams to ensure practical and compliant policy rollout.

🧩 I integrated my software and BI experience to explain concepts in an accessible way for diverse stakeholders.

📘 These documents were reused in onboarding, internal reviews, and helped shape our evolving cloud security posture.

🔄 I treated each topic not just as a configuration task, but as an opportunity to document learnings, streamline decisions, and avoid future technical debt.

🔹 AZURE "ENTRA"NCE "ID"ENTITY: A Comprehensive Guide to IAM in Azure
I developed this guide to help bridge my existing software and BI background into a solid understanding of cloud-native identity management. It breaks down the architecture of Microsoft Entra ID, highlighting differences from traditional AD, and shows how authentication, authorization, and access policies interact. We later used this document across our cloud migration team to align on terminology and enforce consistent access patterns across environments.

🔹 Microsoft Entra ID & Azure RBAC Security Q\&A — Consolidated by Topic
While implementing RBAC policies across shared Azure subscriptions, I compiled this Q\&A to address key concepts and decision points. I researched Entra ID roles, access scopes, and permission resolution, and brought in questions that arose during team design sessions. This helped us establish a shared understanding between cloud engineers and security leads when assigning access in a multi-tenant structure.

🔹 ENTRA ID INTUNE Q & A
As we began to enforce device compliance via Microsoft Intune, I took the initiative to document how identity, policy enforcement, and device registration work together. I tested scenarios across platforms, gathered requirements from the endpoint management team, and validated our policy assumptions. The Q\&A became a reference we used during deployment planning to avoid configuration gaps and user friction.

🔹 RBAC INTUNE ENTRA Q & A — Continued
This continuation dives deeper into specific access issues involving hybrid identity setups, nested roles, and conditional access layering. I worked through edge cases with the help of Intune admins and security architects, then documented common solutions and misconfigurations. This collaboration ensured we were implementing roles with correct scopes while avoiding privilege overlap.

🔹 Why Privileged Admin Roles Appear in Azure RBAC (Even Though They Don’t Control Resources)
I noticed confusion across teams when privileged directory roles appeared in the RBAC assignment UI despite not granting resource-level access. To clarify this, I researched Microsoft’s role modeling and wrote an internal note that explains the difference between visibility and enforcement. This write-up helped us correct how these roles were perceived during audits and governance reviews.

🔹 Azure RBAC Roles Comparison
As part of a platform hardening effort, I led the development of a detailed role comparison matrix to evaluate access at each scope: management group, subscription, and resource. We used this to guide decision-making around custom role creation, align with security’s least-privilege goals, and communicate access risks with project owners. It became a foundational tool for access governance discussions.

🔹 Managed Identity: a System-Defined Service Principal?
During infrastructure automation work, I needed to ensure that services could securely access resources without hardcoded credentials. I investigated how managed identities function internally — including identity assignment, token issuance, and integration with Azure services. I then documented guidance on when to use system- vs user-assigned identities, which we later applied in our DevOps CI/CD workflows.

🔹 Consolidated Hierarchy of Azure AD
To improve onboarding and architectural alignment, I created this reference visualizing the hierarchical structure of Entra ID: tenants, users, groups, apps, and enterprise roles. It helped us align directory structure decisions with governance policies and provided clarity when onboarding cross-functional teams to new identity configurations.

🌐 Azure Networking — Design, Implementation & Operational Notes
🧠 Reflections on My Networking Work
🧪 I configured and tested Azure networking features in sandbox environments to understand their real-world behavior, beyond docs.

🔧 I used hands-on scripting and tooling (PowerShell, Azure CLI) to diagnose and fix network issues across virtual environments.

🤝 We collaborated across infrastructure, firewall, and support teams to ensure secure and reliable network topologies were put in place.

📚 I created these documents not just for delivery, but for future reuse — enabling faster troubleshooting and decision-making for others.

🔹 About vNet Peering
I explored vNet peering while designing a secure communication path between isolated environments. I set up regional and global peering configurations in test subscriptions to validate latency, routing behavior, and service discovery. We used this setup to connect a dev/test environment with shared infrastructure like Key Vault and Azure Firewall. I documented both limitations (e.g. no transitive peering) and best practices, which became part of our network topology planning checklist.

🔹 Site-to-Site VPN Setup Between VNETs
To support hybrid connectivity for an on-prem-to-cloud migration, I configured a site-to-site VPN gateway between Azure and a simulated on-prem VM in my lab. I captured each step — from local network gateway creation to shared key setup and BGP configuration. We later referred to this when deploying the real production VPN with our infrastructure team. The doc helped ensure subnet alignment, routing table correctness, and high availability considerations were not missed.

🔹 Network Connectivity Test Suite: ICMP & TCP Port Diagnostics with PowerShell
While troubleshooting inconsistent VM connectivity, I created a reusable diagnostic script suite using PowerShell and Azure CLI. It checks ICMP ping responses, TCP port accessibility, NSG flow logs, and routing table state. This helped us quickly isolate issues related to firewall policies and asymmetric routing. I shared the scripts with the support team and added usage examples to our internal wiki for future ops incidents.

🔹 Special Subnets in Azure: What, Why & When to Use Them
I wrote this reference to capture my research into Azure-reserved subnets (GatewaySubnet, AzureBastionSubnet, AzureFirewallSubnet, etc.). I found that many deployment failures came from improperly configured or incorrectly sized subnets. By consolidating this information — including CIDR size recommendations and naming conventions — I helped the team avoid rework during environment provisioning. The doc became a checklist item in our network planning stage.

🔹 Data Flows Down the Layers
This conceptual note reflects my effort to understand the OSI model in the context of Azure networking tools. I used it to trace how packet data flows through Azure Load Balancers, NSGs, UDRs, and firewalls. I visualized the flow from L4 (TCP/UDP) down to routing tables and up through L7 with Application Gateway. This helped us explain performance issues and firewall behavior more clearly to stakeholders unfamiliar with the layered architecture.

🔹 Proximity Placement Groups (PPGs) in Azure: What They Are, When to Use Them, and Why They Matter
I researched PPGs during a latency-sensitive workload rollout. I created this doc to explain how co-locating VMs within a physical data center can reduce network latency and improve IOPS performance. Working with our infrastructure architect, we validated placement with az vm list-skus and test deployments. I later used this documentation to justify PPGs in a cost vs performance trade-off session.

🧩 My docs contributed to decision-making frameworks, not just configurations — supporting design and platform reviews.

🔹 Locking Down Azure Storage: Secure Access Strategies
While building a shared storage layer for analytics pipelines, I took the lead in evaluating Azure Storage security options — from firewalls and private endpoints to Shared Access Signatures (SAS) and role-based access. I documented the pros, risks, and limitations of each method. We collaborated with security stakeholders to enforce private network access and eliminate public endpoints. The write-up has since served as our internal baseline for secure storage design.

🔹 MPg-Locking Down Azure Storage: Secure Access Strategies
This was a variant of the original doc prepared for a knowledge-sharing session with a mixed audience of devs and ops. I restructured the content with diagrams and common misconfigurations we had encountered (like wildcard SAS tokens or unscoped firewall rules). I also included guardrails for ARM templates and Bicep deployments, helping us operationalise the access controls across dev environments.

🔹 Azure Disk Encryption with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) and Disk Encryption Sets
While working on compliance alignment for a data-heavy VM workload, I researched the use of CMKs stored in Azure Key Vault for encrypting managed disks. I led the test deployment of Disk Encryption Sets, configuring access policies, permissions, and validating key rotation behavior. We worked with the security team to define key ownership boundaries. This doc later helped justify CMK adoption to meet internal data protection policies.

🔹 Backing Up Managed vs Unmanaged Disks
During an effort to consolidate backup strategies across environments, I created this analysis to clarify how backup processes differ between managed and legacy unmanaged disks. I validated this with Recovery Services Vault behavior and scripting limitations using az backup. The document also includes a decision flowchart we used to drive decommission planning for older workloads.

🔹 Azure Backup Core Concepts Cheat Sheet
I built this quick-reference sheet while studying Azure Backup and implementing vault-based protection for VMs and file shares. It outlines what’s backed up, how backups are triggered and retained, and how vaults differ from storage accounts. I included PowerShell/CLI commands and screenshots for restoring files and entire VMs. This sheet became a training resource during our internal backup maturity review.

🔹 Azure Backup Services (Backup Vault, Recovery Services Vault), Log Analytics Workspace Integration and Backup Reporting Architecture
This document originated from a broader project to standardise backup reporting and auditing across the estate. I led the design and testing of backup vaults and their integration with Log Analytics for centralized reporting. We explored alerts, backup job failures, and tagging strategies for backup policy scope. I captured architectural diagrams showing how backup metadata flows from VM to vault to workspace, which helped clarify things for non-Azure-native teams.

🔹 Azure Monitoring and Backup Architecture [✔]: A Comprehensive Guide
This combined doc was created as a synthesis of our monitoring and backup strategies. I linked Azure Monitor, Recovery Services Vaults, and Azure Policy to show how we could enforce backup compliance at scale.

I also documented lessons from working with distributed apps (Function Apps, Web Apps, VMs) and how to configure diagnostic settings consistently. We used this to improve our observability architecture for customer-facing workloads.

🔹 Azure Monitoring Tools: Structured Notes from Mind Map
I built this as a way to consolidate scattered notes from multiple monitoring labs. It’s structured around components like data sources, metrics vs logs, collection frequency, retention, alerting scope, and automation integrations (Action Groups, Logic Apps). We used this during internal reviews to assess what visibility we had — and where gaps existed — especially for IaaS workloads not yet integrated into centralized dashboards.

🔹 Azure Management and Monitoring Tools — Presentation Notes
This write-up was prepared for a team knowledge transfer session, where I broke down the monitoring stack using practical analogies and architecture diagrams. I tailored it to include cost implications, trade-offs (e.g., workspace design vs data siloing), and cross-region monitoring considerations. The session led to several follow-up questions on how we could improve alerting without overwhelming incident response teams.

🔹 Azure Monitoring: Activity Logs vs. General Logs – A Deep Dive
I authored this document to clarify the difference between platform activity logs and resource-level diagnostic logs — a common point of confusion during incident investigations. I tested several deployments with varying diagnostic settings, then captured where each log type flows (Azure Monitor, Event Hub, Log Analytics). This helped the incident response and security teams better interpret telemetry and reduce noise.

🔹 Key Difference: ✅ Distinguish Activity Logs from (General) Logs
This cheat-sheet version of the previous doc became a reference card shared with onboarding engineers. It highlights:

What gets logged automatically

What requires enabling diagnostic settings

Where logs can be consumed (portal vs queries vs external SIEM)

This helped engineers debug issues more effectively and understand what data was — or wasn’t — available during investigations.

🔹 SQL to KQL Converter and Cheat Sheet for Log Analytics Queries
As I transitioned from SQL-based BI analysis to Azure’s Kusto Query Language (KQL), I built this converter guide for querying logs in Log Analytics. It maps T-SQL patterns to KQL equivalents (e.g., WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, time filtering) and includes copy-paste snippets for common troubleshooting scenarios. I used this to flatten the learning curve for others moving from traditional SQL environments to KQL-powered observability.
